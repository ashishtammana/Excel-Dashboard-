# Analyzing Income and Bike Purchase Pattern

This project report aims to analyze and draw insights from several pivot tables based on a dataset that provides information about income and bike purchase patterns. The dataset contains information related to income, gender, age groups, and distances people are willing to travel for bike purchase. In this report, we will examine the data from these pivot tables and derive meaningful conclusions.


## Data Summary
### Income Analysis
The first pivot table provides data on income, categorized by gender. The table shows that on average, females have an income of $54,581, while males have an income of $58,063. The overall average income across the entire dataset is $56,360.

### Bike Purchase by Distance
The second pivot table offers insights into bike purchases based on the distance people are willing to travel. It reveals that most bike purchases (366 out of 1000) occur when the distance is 0-1 miles. The least popular distance range is more than 10 miles, with only 111 bike purchases.

### Bike Purchase by Age Group
The third pivot table categorizes bike purchases by age group. Middle-aged individuals (aged between 25 and 65) account for the majority of bike purchases, with 719 purchases. Adolescents and older individuals make up the remaining purchases, with 110 and 171, respectively.

###  Bike Purchase by Age
The final pivot table presents bike purchases categorized by age. It demonstrates that most purchases are made by people in their late 20s and early 30s. The highest number of bike purchases is observed at the age of 32, with 33 purchases, while the lowest numbers occur among those aged 68, 70, 71, and 80, with just 1 purchase each.

## Key Findings

Income Analysis: Males tend to have a slightly higher income on average compared to females. The overall average income in the dataset is approximately $56,360.

Bike Purchase by Distance: The data suggests that most bike purchases happen when the distance is within 0-1 miles, indicating that people prefer to buy bikes located closer to them.

Bike Purchase by Age Group: Middle-aged individuals are the primary purchasers of bikes, with the majority of the purchases falling within this age group.

Bike Purchase by Age: The age group with the highest bike purchases is in the late 20s and early 30s. The pattern of bike purchases decreases with age, with minimal purchases observed among older individuals.
## Conclusion
The analysis of the provided pivot tables offers valuable insights into income and bike purchase patterns. These findings can be used to inform marketing strategies, product placement, and pricing decisions for businesses in the bike industry. Understanding the demographics of bike buyers and their preferences for distance and age can help businesses tailor their offerings to better serve their target customers.

It is essential to note that while these findings provide a snapshot of the data, further analysis and additional variables may be necessary to gain a more comprehensive understanding of customer behavior. However, the information presented in this report serves as a solid foundation for informed decision-making in the bike market.

For more detailed analysis or to address specific business goals, additional data and advanced statistical methods may be required.
